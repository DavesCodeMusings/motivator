# Millennial Motivator
An HTML page, CSS, and JavaScript class to display a slideshow of pithy motivational wisdom millennials will be sure to love.

I put this together to display of short motivational sayings for all the externally-validated special little snowflakes trick-or-treating in the neighborhood this year. Message transitions are timed to music, because we're having a family-friendly deep house rave on the driveway.

Message transistions are CSS annimated. You can change the messages displayed by editing the `pithyWisdom` array in the HTML body. You'll also find BPM, that you can adjust to sync up with music if you chose to do so. And there's an option in the CSS to reverse the text if you're using rear projection on a screen.

If nothing else, it's a good introduction to JavaScript classes and CSS transition effects.

Have fun with it!
